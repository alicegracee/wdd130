            <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    Our company established in 2009. It started as a family business. 
                    <br>In 2012 it grew bigger involving people from outside to join and built a water rafting business.
                    <br>In 2014 we reached a new milestone by opening a much larger resort for customers to enjoy and gave instructions on rafting. 
                    <br>In 2022 we opened it for all ages customers to enjoy our resort. We offered not only rafting but also, different entertainment venues to enjoy for toddlers and younger children.
                    <br>Today, we have to offer on our site restaurants, cafes, and playing areas for toddlers and babies. Small pools to enjoy in the water. As well as inflatables and all sorts of fun for families to enjoy.
